		<p class="report-intro">
			The chosen dataset contains Boston residential sales data from 2000 to 2023 and abundant
			information about the seller, buyer, price, location, kind of building, if the sale was a flip, etc.
			Before this assignment, I knew very little about speculation, and after the background reading, I
			was fascinated with the practice because flipping is a hobby I know many of my friends' parents
			participate in. That becomes one of my initial questions, along with other curiosities in flipping
			strategies I was excited to explore as I traversed the rich dataset.

			<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
			<ol class="report-questions">
				<li>
					Are individual or small investors contributing to the negative impacts of speculation? Are
					wealthy individuals that buy and flip houses part of the issue, or is their impact negligible?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Many people I know personally are doing this.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					How do buyers choose property to invest in? Do they choose residences in their
					geographic area? Are certain traits of investors correlated with certain traits of
					residences? For instance, institutional investors are more likely to invest in houses of a
					particularly wealthy or historical zip code.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> This could help us understand how investors choose their property,
						and thus create policy that targets harmful speculation practices.</li>

				</li>
				<li>
					Which sales make the most profit? What types of investors make them? What kinds of
					homes? How much flip time?
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> This information could help us identify factors that make

			<h2>Phase 1: Exploration</h2>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Checking Spatial Data</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/locations.png" alt="Scatter plot of property sale locations across Boston" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					I first began by exploring the spatial data, mapping out the latitude and longitudes. I saw a few
					incorrect values at (0, 0), so I filtered those out. I then found a strange cluster in Maine,
					Northwest of Boston, all with the street, Union Park. I checked their zip code, and confirmed that
					they were meant to be placed at Union Park St in Boston. I fixed those points by remapping
					their latitude and longitudes to that of Union Park St, Boston. Otherwise, I confirmed that the
					spatial data looked clean, including zip codes, street names, and occasionally, addresses.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Search for Individual Sellers</h3>
				<p>
					It initially confused me that there wasn't a category for individual sellers, i.e., regular people just
					selling their houses. There was information about whether each seller was a bank, government
					entity, LLC, trust, etc., but none indicated the kind of seller I had expected to see.
				</p>
				<div class="report-figures-grid">
					<figure>
						<img src="statics/usage-indiv%3F%3F.png" alt="Home usage distribution for non-entity sellers" />
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<img src="statics/style-indiv%3F%3F.png" alt="Home style distribution for non-entity sellers" />
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>
					I attempted to test a proxy for this group by plotting home usage and style against sellers that
					were not any of these large entities. I was searching for some kind of signal that the non-entities
					were individuals, such as them selling single family homes disproportionately more than entities.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/entity-vs-nonentity-total.png" alt="Total sales: entity vs non-entity sellers" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					Since non-entities have many more sales in general, I was not confident in labeling non-entities
					as these regular individuals. Upon further research, I found that wealthy individuals frequently
					sell through LLCs and trusts for liability protection, tax planning, etc., and learned that searching
					for this "individual" did not align with the nature of this data, which records sellers' legal
					form rather than social.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Big Buyers Buy from Big Sellers</h3>
				<p>
					I then performed a sanity check that "big" buyers should buy from "big" sellers. Specifically,
					attributes that make buyers "big," such as being institutional investors, owning many properties,
					having high holding value, etc., bought from similarly "big" sellers.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/buyer-seller-type-heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap of sales frequency between buyer and seller types" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					The heatmap that visualized frequency of sales between all types of buyers and sellers
					exhibited a clear diagonal, confirming that big buyers and big sellers are strongly correlated.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/big-buyers-sellers-big-price.png" alt="Average sale price by buyer and seller type" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					I then wondered what it means for a sale to be "big," and if big buyers and sellers make big
					purchases. I decided to use the price of the sale as my "bigness" proxy, and by plotting price
					across both buyer and seller types in a line chart, I verified that the average price of homes by
					buyers and sellers of the same type are very similar as well. Big buyers make big purchases
					from big sellers.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Time Trends</h3>
				<p>With over 20 years of data, I created basic exploratory visualizations of key variables over time.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/price-over-time.png" alt="Median sale price and flip profit over time" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					First, I plotted average price and flipped profit over time to view large temporal trends in the
					housing price points. They both seemed to be steadily increasing, although they appeared to
					have substantial volatility. I found that averaging real-estate sales was ineffective due to being
					skewed by extreme high-value outliers. I switched to medians to more accurately reflect the
					typical property in the market. After switching, I found a much smoother upward trend in price
					and price difference over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also experimented with spatial animations over time to get a sense of how sales behavior
					moved around Boston over time.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<video controls>
						<source src="statics/cash-animation.mov" type="video/mp4" />
						Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>
				</figure>
				<p>
					I visualized where cash sales seemed to be densest over time, and saw a peak around 2012
					(which I confirmed with a basic line chart), but not explicit movement to and from a particular area.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<video controls>
						<source src="statics/percent-investor-animation.mov" type="video/mp4" />
						Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Next, I explored which zip codes investors were targeting throughout time. By coloring zip codes
					by the number of purchases made by investors in the sales of that area, I could easily grasp that
					investors have always been drawn to Back Bay but are steadily expanding their reach across Boston.
				</p>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Price Distribution</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/price-distribution.png" alt="Logarithmic price distribution by buyer type" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					Lastly, I looked at a logarithmic distribution of price across types of buyers for a high-level
					overview. Institutional buyers have a very wide range of sales, with the highest max by orders of
					magnitude. However, their median sale is a bit lower but comparable to other buyer types. Small
					and non-investors are the most concentrated groups, with most of their sales falling between
					around $300,000 and $2,000,000.

		<section class="report-section">
			<h2>Phase 2: Answering Questions</h2>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Q1: Are individual or small investors contributing to the negative impacts of speculation?</h3>
				<p>
					Since my initial exploration found that legal identity doesn't map cleanly onto economic
					behavior, the relevant distinction is not whether an investor is an individual or an incorporated
					entity, but whether they operate at a small scale. For this reason, I used the "Small Investor"
					category to capture small-scale actors regardless of legal structure.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/flip-frequency-buyers.png" alt="Flip frequency by buyer type and flip term" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					I first checked if small buyers were disproportionately associated with short-term flips, an
					indication of rapid turnover. If small investors drove rapid turnover activity, they would be raising
					bidding pressure and amplifying price cycles. I found that although small investors perform the
					most short-term flips, the relationship is proportionate since small investors perform more flips
					overall. However, it is clear that small investors play a very large role in the flipping scheme.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/small-over-time.png" alt="Small investor share of buyer investors over time" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					Since my last visualization was an aggregation of all data over the 20 years, I checked the
					investor composition across time to see if small investors were a growing force in flipping.
					Mapping the percentage that small investors made of buyer investors over time, however, it
					appeared as if small investors have consistently made up the largest part of the investor
					composition, and their share has remained relatively stagnant over time.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/year-built-flips.png" alt="Year built of flipped properties by investor type" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					Lastly, I investigated if small investors were disproportionately targeting historic residences.
					Older housing is often cheaper because they're located in lower-income or transitional
					neighborhoods, so targeting older housing can amplify affordability pressure if paired with rapid
					resale and high markups. Conversely, it seems like medium investors target the oldest
					residences, while small investors tend to purchase newer homes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Small-scale investors don't appear to disproportionately drive short-term speculative flipping.
					Their market share has remained relatively stable over time, and they are more active in newer
					housing stock rather than older distressed properties. The evidence does not strongly support a
					narrative that "regular wealthy individuals" are increasing speculative pressure in the Boston
					residential market.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Q2: How do buyers choose property to invest in?</h3>
				<div class="report-figures-grid">
					<figure>
						<img src="statics/buyer-zips-map.png" alt="Buyer type distribution across top zip codes (map)" />
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<img src="statics/buyer-zips-heat-no-non.png" alt="Buyer type vs zip code heatmap (excluding non-investors)" />
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>
					My initial instinct was to find zip codes or regions that attracted certain types of investors. After
					looking at the zip codes with the most sales and how buyer types were distributed across them,
					I couldn't find a clear correlation between any buyer type and zip code. All groups seemed
					evenly spread between the top 6 zip codes with most sales. Since spatial quantities were
					difficult to interpret, I created a heat map excluding non-investors due to scale dominance and to
					focus on investors, and found no abnormal associations between ZIP code and buyer type.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/riviera.png" alt="Yearly heatmap of buyer type by zip code revealing anomalous spikes" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					I wondered if the previous zip code visuals lacked nuance because they were aggregated over
					the past 20 years, so I studied the same heatmap but for each year rather than overall. At first, I
					observed the same pattern of smaller investors buying more in all zip codes, except for one or
					two spikes in institutional investment in certain years. However, once I looked more closely at
					these spikes in institutional investment, I found that they were caused by units of a large
					building being sold as separate purchases. Since the colors are mapped by count and splitting
					the data by year led to much lower values, these large purchases heavily skewed the data.
				</p>
				<div class="report-figures-grid">
					<figure>
						<img src="statics/buyer-use-map.png" alt="Buyer type by residence usage (spatial map)" />
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<img src="statics/buyer-use-heat.png" alt="Buyer type by atypical residence usage (heatmap)" />
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>
					Since it didn't seem that investor type was related to zip code, I instead looked at my next best
					guess for a factor that investors heavily considered, residence usage. With the spatial map, I
					noticed that a few usages did not follow the previous trend: non-investors largely avoided them
					rather than being the most prominent type of investor. In the heatmap, I excluded all usages that
					followed the pattern of "smaller buyer buys more of the residence" to focus on the atypical
					cases. The next most common pattern seemed to be that small investors were the prominent
					buyer. General office spaces and retail stores, however, were bought out most by large
					investors. This could suggest that some property types require expertise, capital, or risk
					tolerance beyond typical households, and small investors are not uniformly driving all market
					activity. Their dominance is limited to certain property uses.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="report-subsection">
				<h3>Q3: Which sales make the most profit?</h3>
				<p>
					I expected that bigger investors would make higher profit, so I was more interested in who
					makes more profit off of the flip relative to the original price. To check the quality of the profit
					data, I created basic graphs of price diff %. I found many abnormally large values, and after
					investigating their last and new sale prices, concluded that many percent differences were
					calculated incorrectly or exhibited divide-by-zero errors because of missing prices. I filtered out
					rows with missing prices and recreated the percent price difference field by calculating
					(price - last sale price / last sale price) * 100. There were still some extraordinarily high percent
					differences, and I enjoyed researching the buildings that exhibited these extreme flips. The
					highest percent difference was a shocking 1 million percent for 660 Beacon St by an institutional
					buyer, which turned out to be the building attached to the historic Citgo sign!
				</p>
				<p>
					Since I was focusing on profit off of flips, I also investigated the flip information. The flipped
					horizon column seemed corrupted, with many negative values. I chose to use the month horizon
					attribute instead, which had a clean domain of 0–24 months.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/flipped-distribution-horizons.png" alt="Box and whisker of flip profit % by buyer type, colored by flip horizon" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					A comprehensive box and whisker plot allowed me to quickly understand how percentage flip
					profit was higher for bigger buyers. Coloring by the amount of months it took for each flip, there
					was no immediate relation between flip horizon and profit. I then wondered, though, if bigger
					buyers took longer or smaller time to flip, and if that had any connection to their profit. This led
					me to my next visual.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/flip-composition.png" alt="Flip time composition by buyer type" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					It seems like flip time is unrelated to buyer type and profit, since institutional investors actually
					have low flip times, potentially because they have the resources to complete their flips faster.
					Medium investors also seem to have shorter flip times, but the rest have higher ones. There
					doesn't seem to be consistency between flip time and profit. I figure that the flipping strategies
					that maximize profit differ for each buyer type and flip time. I chose to split out those variables
					in the next visualization.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="statics/flip-profitability.png" alt="Scatter grid of flip profitability by investor type and flip term" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					My final visualization attempts to capture potential strategies of buyers according to their
					investor type, flip term, and percentage of their purchase in mortgage. The combination of these
					factors allow us to analyze the profitability of buyer portfolios with varying risk tolerance, capital,
					and experience. Profit percentage is placed on the y-axis to capture investment performance,
					while mortgage share on the x-axis proxies for leverage and financial risk. Arranging the scatter
					within a grid of buyer investor type and flip term isolates differences in scale and holding
					strategy, allowing comparison of how leverage relates to profitability across investor groups and
					time horizons. Immediately, we can take away some really fascinating insights! For long-term
					flips of any investor type, highest profitability follows lower mortgage percentages and thus
					favors lower leverage risk. For non-investors, however, many are able to gain profit with medium
					and high mortgage percentages regardless of the flip term.

		<section class="report-section">
			<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>Many visuals and perspectives can be used to answer one question. One visual is never
				conclusive.</strong> I was surprised to find how many combinations of variables, format, filters, etc. could
				be utilized to explore one seemingly simple question. It took a large number of those to feel
				content with an investigation. Each visual required a few more simple charts to confirm certain
				traits about each dimension of data, and prompted a dozen more follow-up questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Bigger and aggregate data doesn't mean better.</strong> We're used to seeing nice strong trends and
				expressive, intuitive visuals, but when exploring raw data, it's very rare that you'll see what you
				expect by just plotting one variable on y and another on x. Achieving a clear trend often comes
				with some good intuition on the visualizer's part, extensive research, clever choice of chart and
				colors, and many layers of filtering and cleaning. <strong>Smaller, more filtered data also doesn't mean
				better.</strong> After some initial explorations of such a large dataset, it felt like many layers of filtering
				and scoping down would bring out important nuances. In many cases, however, it led to
				muddying by outliers and unclean data.
